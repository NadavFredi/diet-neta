-- Seed script to create test users
-- This runs after all migrations
-- Note: Direct inserts into auth.users don't work due to security policies
-- Users must be created via Supabase Admin API or manually through the UI

-- This file is a placeholder - users should be created via:
-- 1. Supabase Studio UI (http://localhost:54323)
-- 2. Or via the create_test_users.js script
